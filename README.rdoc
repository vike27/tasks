Project to Learn TDD using Rails.

I will be building a full tasks application over the weekend.

I am using the following for my test suite:

  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'guard-rspec'
  
Wish me luck!

Plan to use this as a code basis to share with friends who want to learn TDD in the future. Great first exercise!
